            <h2>Turtle Species of Sri Lanka </h2>
            <p>Sri Lanka is lucky to have five of the seven live sea turtle species documented in the globe reported along the beautiful coastline belt of the island - arriving for breeding.
            
            The "big five" include the Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), Hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), Loggerhead (Caretta caretta), Olive Ridley (Chelonia mydas), and Hawksbill (Lepidochelys olivacea).<br><br>There are three species of freshwater turtles and one terrestrial tortoise in Sri Lanka. The freshwater turtles are Parker's Black Turtle (Melanochelys trijuga pakeri) Sri Lanka Black Turtle (Melanochelys trijuga thermalis) and the Soft or Flapshell turtle (Lissemys punctata punctata).</p>

                  <h3>Green Turtle</h3>
                  <p text align="justify">In Sri Lankan waters, the green turtle is the most prevalent. An mature female can lay between 120 and 40 eggs at a time, and she can grow to a maximum length of 1m and weigh about 250kg.

                  <h3>Hawksbill Turtle</h3>
                  <p text align="justify">Then comes the slightly uncommon Hawksbill Turtle, which is critically endangered. As a result, it is considerably smaller, with a maximum length of 90 cm and a weight range of 50–70 kg. The hawksbill's narrow head and bird-like beak, which are designed to trap creatures hidden in small cracks, are how it got its name. Despite being smaller, this one is well known for its stunning shell, which is composed of 13 symmetrical, vibrant parts. </p>

                  <h3>Loggerhead Turtles</h3>
                  <p text align="justify">The Loggerhead Turtle is easily recognized by its distinctively large head and is typically colored red and brown. These are predominantly carnivores that may reach a maximum height of 1 m and weight between 170 and 200 kg. Their big, powerful jaws are perfect for crushing mollusks and crustaceans, which are their favorite food.</p>

                  <p text align="justify">The Leatherback Turtle, the largest of Sri Lanka's five kinds and a critically endangered Giant of the turtle world, is tragically close to being extinct. With its distinctive black and white striped shell and large front flippers, this one is easy to identify. Its carapace, which gives it the appearance of leather, is actually a layer of thin, durable, rubbery skin dotted with hundreds of bone plates. In actuality, it is the only species of sea turtle that lack a hard shell.</p>

                <p><img src="images/olive1.jpg"  style="width:230px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;"><h3>Olive Ridley</h3>
                  The smallest species found in the country; the Olive Ridley reaches a maximum size of 65cm and weighs just 35 to 45kg. It is named after it’s olive/rust coloured shell or carapace.</p>

              <h2>Why are the Sea Turtles important?</h2>

              <p><img src="images/narigama1.jpg"  style="width:230px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;"><h3>BEACHES</h3>
                Sea turtles also have a positive influence on water. Nesting sea turtles help beaches by depositing their eggs in the sand. Eggshells and unhatched eggs left behind provide important nutrients that nourish dune vegetation such as beach grasses, which stabilise dunes and help to prevent coastal erosion.</p>
            <br><br><br><br><br>

            <p><img src="images/coral1.jpg" style="width:230px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;"><h3>CORAL REEFS</h3>
                Hawksbills nest on coral reefs and are known for only consuming a few types of sea sponges. The variety of life on the reef is increased by this diet, allowing the growth of uncommon forms of sponges. Without Hawksbills, sponges might overgrow, suffocate, and kill slow-growing corals. The Hawksbill's position on the reef has grown even more important as it faces increasing threats from climate change and other negative factors. </p>                
    <br><br><br>

    <p><img src="images/pred1.jpg"  style="width: 230px;height:150px;margin-right:15px;"><h3>TURTLE PREDATORS</h3>
        Sea turtles are prey for other animals at all stages of life. Hatchlings are prey for birds, crabs, land mammals, and fish. Adult sea turtles are prey for apex predators like sharks and orcas.</p>
    <br><br><br><br>


    <p><img src="images/prey1.jpg"  style="width: 230px;height:150px;margin-right:15px;"><h3>TURTLE PREY</h3>
        Sea turtles primarily eat jellyfish, which keeps the jellyfish population in check and prevents an imbalance in marine biodiversity. Adult green sea turtles also eat seagrass, which provides habitat, food, and protects nursery areas for many fish species.</p>
    <br><br><br><br>
    
    <p><img src="images/help1.jpg"  style="width: 230px;height:150px;margin-right:15px;"><h3>HELPING OTHERS</h3>
        Sea turtles provide habitat for aquatic hitchhikers, act as an umbrella for fish, and provide a resting spot for seabirds. They are also attractive and charismatic.</p>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <p><img src="images/imp1.jpg"  style="width: 230px;height:150px;margin-right:15px;"><h3>IMPORTANCE TO HUMANS</h3>
        Sea turtles are an important cultural and economic resource for many coastal communities. Research has shown that turtle-watching ecotourism can generate three times the income of selling sea turtle parts, making them worth more alive than dead. They are also a source of awe and inspiration, and without them, our blue planet would be incomplete.</p>

    <h2>What can we do to save the Sea Turtles of Sri Lanka?</h2>
    
<ol id="inc"><li>Reduce marine debris that may entangle or be accidentally eaten by sea turtles.</li><br><br>
    <li>Participate in coastal clean-ups and reduce plastic use to keep our beaches and ocean clean. The trash in the ocean can harm sea turtles and other creatures that live there.</li><br><br>
    <li>Carry reusable water bottles and shopping bags. Refrain from releasing balloons, they'll likely end up in the ocean where sea turtles can mistake them for prey and consume them.</li><br><br>
    <li>Keep nesting beaches dark and safe for sea turtles. Turn off, shield, or redirect lights visible from the beach. Lights disorient hatchling sea turtles and discourage nesting females from coming onto the beach to lay their eggs.</li><br>
    <li>Do not disturb nesting turtles, nests, or hatchlings. Attend organised sea turtle watches that know how to safely observe nesting sea turtles.</li><br><br>
    <li>Remove recreational beach equipment like chairs, umbrellas, boats at night - so that sea turtles are not turned away.</li><br><br>
    <li>Fill in holes and knockdown sandcastles before you leave the beach. They can become obstacles for nesting turtles or emerging hatchlings.</ol><br>
    <hr style="height:3px;border-width:0;color:rgb(81, 129, 216);background-color:rgb(95, 116, 217)">
            
    <h2>Where can we see Sea Turtles in Sri Lanka?</h2>
<p>Turtle watching is an amazing experience beyond explanation. Watching these calm and peaceful critters in the sea, slowly swimming, looking for their next meal, or hauling themselves up to a sandy beach for nesting - is something that is bound to be in your memory for a long time.<br><br>

    Depending on the season, Rekawa, Hikkaduwa, Mirissa, Kosgoda, Beruwala and Trincomalee can be considered as the best places in the island to catch a glimpse of these great turtles… or maybe have a swim with them, if you get lucky.</p>
